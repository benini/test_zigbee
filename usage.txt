Usage Guide
1. Initial Setup

    Flash the firmware to your ESP32-C6
    The device will start as a Zigbee Coordinator and automatically form a network
    The network will open for joining (you'll see "Network open for joining" in logs)

2. Pair the Sonoff ZBMINIR2

    Put your Sonoff ZBMINIR2 in pairing mode (usually by pressing the button 5 times quickly)
    The ESP32-C6 will automatically detect and pair with the device
    You'll see "New device joined!" in the logs

3. BLE Configuration (using nRF Connect)

    Open nRF Connect on your smartphone
    Scan for devices and find "ZB_Switch_Ctrl"
    Connect to the device
    Navigate to the custom service (UUID starting with 12345678...)
    You'll see two characteristics:
        ON Duration (UUID ending in F1): Read/Write - Current: 30 seconds (0x1E000000)
        OFF Duration (UUID ending in F2): Read/Write - Current: 60 seconds (0x3C000000)

4. Changing Timer Values

    To write a new value, enter the duration in seconds as a little-endian uint32_t
    Examples:
        10 seconds: 0A 00 00 00
        30 seconds: 1E 00 00 00
        60 seconds: 3C 00 00 00
        120 seconds: 78 00 00 00
    The change takes effect immediately on the next cycle
